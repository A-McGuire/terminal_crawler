# terminal_crawler


This is a CLI app that crawls Turing School's Terminal looking for broken project links.  
I built this app in an effort to give back to the Turing community. I have a version of this app that emails the owners of the broken links to notify them however for the sake of those individuals inboxes I decided it would be best to keep that version private.
