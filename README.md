# terminal_crawler


This is a CLI app that crawls Turing School's Terminal looking for broken project links.  
I built this app in an effort to give back to the Turing community. I have a version of this app that emails the owners of the broken links to notify them however for the sake of those individuals inboxes I decided it would be best to keep that version private.

At the moment Turing's Terminal is host to 130 alumni profiles. The app takes quite a while to run due to the number of links to check and more importantly the number of projects hosted on free, slow to wake up, Heroku servers.

Ruby Version 3.0.0
